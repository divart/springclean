# SpringClean

Author: [John Gardner](http://arconixpc.com)

### Requirements

SpringClean uses the Genesis Framework from [StudioPress](http://studiopress.com)

### Theme Notes

The SpringClean theme was designed with simplicity in mind. There is a widget area in the header for a menu and in the footer.

The theme's CSS was constructed using [LESS](http://lesscss.org/). Those files are located in `/includes/less/`. LESS outputs standard CSS so it's use is not required to make desired design changes.

All the icons are generated using [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

The Post Format details are handled by [WooTumblog](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-tumblog/) and a bit of custom integration code.
